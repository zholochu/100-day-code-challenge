# You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

# ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
# ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
# ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
# Return the number of items that match the given rule.
# @param {String[][]} items
# @param {String} rule_key
# @param {String} rule_value
# @return {Integer}

# Example 1:
# Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

# Example 2:
# Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.
